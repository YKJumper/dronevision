# To incorporate the ability to switch control between the drone's operator and the autopilot via a dedicated channel on the transmitter/receiver (TX/RX) trunks, you'll 
# need to monitor the state of that channel and decide when to allow autopilot commands to control the drone versus when to pass through manual control commands from the operator.
# This requires reading the dedicated channel's state, implementing a control switch mechanism, and ensuring a smooth transition between control states.
